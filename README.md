<h1> The Odin Project </h1>
<h2> Project: HTML/CSS </h2>
<h3>Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage</h3>
<ol>
<li>Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your <img> tag.</li>
<li>Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. Check out how to build a horizontal CSS navbar if you're lost.</li>
<li>Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.</li>
